Brief Description:I had created a small Web Application for a Copy Center. I found that the copy center at Northeastern University uses Microsoft Outlook to go through the print job that the students place and had no definite application to handle all the request nor to track the student order. I thought of developing this application so that it would be easier for students as well as the employees at the center to provide a fast and efficient way to place print orders.ÊThe student workflow is simple, the student logs in, uploads the document that needs to be printed, select the predefined values such as type of paper, size, print type, color or black and white, poster or photo, etc. Along with that, he/she can also place special request in the description box, track the status of previous order and message the employee at the copy center.The employee on the other hand, can view the requests and all the description about the print job, download the file, change the status and reply to the student messages.Technologies Used:Java, HTML, JSP, CSS, Apache Tiles.Build Tool: MavenFrameworks: Spring MVC, HibernateDatabase: MySQLDeveloped using: Eclipse IDE with Spring Tool SuiteServer: Apache Tomcat.
